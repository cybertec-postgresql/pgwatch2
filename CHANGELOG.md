## Running the latest version

```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 8080:8080 --name pw2 cybertec/pgwatch2    # InfluxDB version
# OR
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 8080:8080 --name pw2 cybertec/pgwatch2-postgres   # Postgres version
```

or a specific version

```docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 8080:8080 --name pw2 cybertec/pgwatch2:x.y.z```

## Notice on updating old setups

When migrating existing "config DB" based setups, all previous schema migration diffs with bigger version numbers need to be
applied first from the "pgwatch2/sql/config_store/migrations/" (or /etc/pgwatch2/sql/config_store/migrations/ if using
ther pre-built packages) folder. Also it is highly recommended to refresh all the metric definitions as they're constantly improved.
For that there's also a refresh_metrics_from_github.sh script provided. YAML based setups don't need any extra actions besides
refreshing from Git or installing the new RPM / DEB / Tar packages.

## v1.8.5 [2021-05-03]

Main changes:

* TimescaleDB metric storage fix - honor retention management via --pg-retention-days parameter. Previously workaround was to configure TimescaleDB directly.
* Gatherer fix - honor user input on InfluxDB SSL cert ignoring in all InfluxDB operations.
* Gatherer improvement - support monitoring all PgBouncer pools from a single config entry when "DB name" left empty.
* A new "Sessions overview" dashboards - together with some new 'backends' columns, gives a high-level user activity overview. PG only.
* Gatherer improvement - do not consider rds_superuser on AWS RDS as superuser anymore to get rid of some out-of-the-box errors.
* Metrics - reduce the amount of data pulled in by limiting most metrics to max 300 entries as mostly the "smaller fish" is not looked at.
* Metrics - ignore TimescaleDB sub-partition (chunk) statistics for tables and only aggregating on the topmost level.
* Metrics - add a 'gce' preset tuned for Google GCE managed PostgreSQL engine.
* Metrics - adjust 'azure' preset by removing some metrics that generated errors by default.
* Metrics - add 'sequence_health' metric + an accompanying get_sequences() helper to be able to detect upcoming sequence overflows.
* Metrics - make some 'backend' fields more consistent. AV workers count now also into "total active per DB".
* Metrics - make "stat_statements" 3x more performant. Thanks @bukem.
* Metrics - add 4 avg query / TX characteristic columns to the "backend" metric to complement max values.
* Config DB - adjust the SQL schema to be re-rollout proof.
* Dashboards - fix "Tables top" for Grafana v7.4+ as there was some backwards-incompatible change.
* Dashboards - only use fully qualified object names so that metrics could drop returning schema and table name separately in next version.
* Dashboards - DB overview unprivileged: replace 1h DB growth with "tups fetched vs returned".
* Documentation - a new chapter on monitoring managed cloud instances, plus many other smaller corrections.
* Docker - start using multi-stage builds to compile the gatherer, reducing the image size slightly.
* K8s / Openshift - Helm chart deployment template corrections. Thanks @pmpetit
* Docker - component update to InfluxDB 1.8.5, Grafana 6.7.5, Go 1.16.3.

NB! If upgrading from an older TimescaleDB storage based setup you should additionally re-roll out the [following file](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pgwatch2/blob/master/pgwatch2/sql/metric_store/01_old_metrics_cleanup_procedure.sql)
on the Metrics DB to make pgwatch2 honor the --pg-retention-days parameter.

## v1.8.4 [2021-02-12]

Main changes:

* TimescaleDB metric storage - cope with v2.0 breaking API changes and improve indexing.
* New gatherer feature - ability to extract "psutil_*" metrics (CPU, disk usage etc) directly from OS. Use "--direct-os-stats" parameter to enable.
* Gatherer improvement - make Graphite storage connections more resilient. @eshkinkot
* Gatherer improvement - add number of total monitored and currently unreachable databases to the stats port output.
* Metrics - introduce a new 'instance_up' metric with values \[0|1\] to help with SLA type "uptime percentage" calculations.
* Metrics - correct wal_receiver.replay_lag_b datatype to int8. @eshkinkot
* Metrics - 'replication' now supports also cascaded setups as pg_stat_replication has actually data on "cascading primaries".
* Dashboards - on PG "Alert template" dash replace DB based "Available connections" with "Instance connections used %".
* Docker - give Grafana some more time to roll out its DB schema migrations.
* Docker - introduce an explicit supervisord startup script to better time the startup sequence (5s pauses between components).
* Docker - component update to InfluxDB 1.8.4, Grafana 6.7.5, Go 1.5.8.
* Docker - limit Python PIP to pre v21 versions as it was breaking the build.
* K8s / Openshift - more and better Helm chart templates.

* Gatherer improvement - do not connect to config DB in adhoc mode as it's not really not needed.
* Gatherer improvement - add "totalMetricFetchFailuresCounter" to the Stats / Health-check port output.
* Postgres metrics DB - try per-table dropping of old data partitions first, to reduce the chance of running out of locks.

* Docker component update - Go 1.15.6.

This release added 1 SQL diff to be applied for Config DB based setups:

* Code - switch to Go Modules (@pashagolub).

NB! When migrating existing "config DB" based setups, all previous schema migration diffs with bigger version numbers need to be
applied first from the "pgwatch2/sql/config_store/migrations/" (or /etc/pgwatch2/sql/config_store/migrations/ if using
